                        I am the founder and the CEO of Costly. I love travelling and photography thus my motivation of
                        founding Costly.
                        Here, I feel at home. Other than travelling, my mission is to provide job opportunities for the
                        youth through technology.
                        <br><br>
                        I am currently a student at African Leadership College, Mauritius, pursuing BSc(Hons) Computing.
                        I love programming,
                        network technology and cyber security. I am good in java, python, html, css and android
                        development. I am a freelance
                        programmer when taking a break from school work and I enjoy it so much.
